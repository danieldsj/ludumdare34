# lumdum34
This was my submission for Lumdum DareJ 34. The theme was "Two Button Controls" and "Growing".

I have never programmed anything in javascript before. I have never used the phaser engine before. I started on 2015-12-12 at 2200h EST. I finished on 2015-12-13 at 1100h EST. 

The premise is pretty simple:
* Based on Alice in Wonderland. 
* Drink potion to shrink. 
* Eat cake to grow. 
* Avoid the lava. 
* Catch the white rabbit in record time.
